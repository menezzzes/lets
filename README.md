# Letâ€™s - A Full-Stack Task Management App

** this project is still in development fase**


**Letâ€™s** is a full-stack to-do list application designed to help you organize, track, and complete your tasks efficiently. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it offers seamless task management with persistent storage and a modern user experience.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Add, edit, mark as complete/incomplete, and delete tasks.
- **Filters**: View tasks by their status â€“ *All*, *Completed*, or *Incomplete*.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored in a MongoDB database for secure and scalable data handling.
- **RESTful API**: Built with Express and Node.js for managing tasks.
- **Frontend**: A responsive React-based UI for an interactive user experience.
- **Backend**: A robust Express.js server for handling API requests.
- **Database**: MongoDB for reliable data persistence.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Axios, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **UUID**: For generating unique task IDs

## API Endpoints

### Task Routes
| Method | Endpoint       | Description               |
|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| GET    | /api/tasks     | Fetch all tasks           |
| POST   | /api/tasks     | Add a new task            |
| PUT    | /api/tasks/:id | Update an existing task   |
| DELETE | /api/tasks/:id | Delete a task             |

## How It Works

1. **Frontend**:
   - Users can add, edit, delete, and filter tasks using the React UI.
   - API requests are sent to the backend using Axios.

2. **Backend**:
   - API endpoints handle task operations (CRUD) using Express.js.
   - Tasks are stored and retrieved from a MongoDB database.

3. **Database**:
   - MongoDB stores all task information securely.
